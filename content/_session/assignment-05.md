For this assignment you will write answers in response to four of the handouts on the critical approach to the Bible, and esp. to the Pentateuch: H/O&#39;s #40, #61, #62, &amp; #63.

You do not need to write a response to H/O #60, #64, or #65.

For each of those four handouts, describe something you learned, and also something that took you by surprise for each of the four handouts.

For describing something you learned, it can be, but it does not need to be, &lt;something you learned about the Bible&gt;. It can also simply be &lt;something you learned about how critical scholars view the Pentateuch or the Bible, in general&gt;.

Your responses should be one or two paragraphs each, not simply one sentence. The total length of this assignment should be about two pages (= one page, front &amp; back).
