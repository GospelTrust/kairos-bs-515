Under the Sinai covenant, if an Israelite deliberately committed a murder, he (or she) was to be put to death (Exod 21:14; Num 35:16–22; Num 35 :31; Deut 19:11–13). This is stated very clearly.

But what if a person caused someone’s death, but it was accidental? Or, it was not clear to the community whether it was deliberate or accidental? What was to be done then? This is where the six cities of refuge come in. In many English translations, the person who caused the death is called a “man-slayer” (Num 35:11 &amp; 12, 26 &amp; 27). We will use that term below.

1. Read Numbers 35, Deut 4:41–43, and Deut 19.

2. `6 pts` Did God specifically identify the six cities, or did he instruct the Israelites to select them?

   List the verses(s) which say so.

3. `6 pts` If a person commits a deliberate murder, are they allowed to be safe in a city of refuge?

   List the verses(s) which say so, and summarize what they say in your own words.

4. `2 pts` List at least one verse which tells us that a man-slayer who flees to a city of refuge will be put on trial before the assembly.

5. `6 pts` If a man-slayer is not convicted of murder, he will be allowed to remain in a city of refuge, where he will be safe. How long does he have to stay in the city of refuge? List the verses(s) which say so.

6. `6 pts` But if a man-slayer leaves the city of refuge before he is allowed to leave, then what can happen to him?

   List the verses which say so.

7. `4 pts` In your own words, summarize the purpose of the cities of refuge.
