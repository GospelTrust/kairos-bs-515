###### NOTE
<pre>
You may also count reading Exod chs. 3–14 for this assignment as part of your Reading Report for this course.
</pre>

In this assignment, you will look at the chapters in Exodus which talk about Pharaoh&#39;s heart &lt;becoming hard&gt;.

##### The theological/spiritual question is this:

> Did God simply choose to harden Pharaoh&#39;s heart, such that Pharaoh had no choice in the matter? If that is so, then how can God hold Pharaoh morally accountable for something that God, in effect, forced him to do?

There are a total of `18 verses` in Exodus which explicitly mention this.

To find these verses, you will need to use a concordance, either a printed one, or an online concordance. You will need to search on the words &quot;hard,&quot; &quot;harden,&quot; and/or &quot;hardened&quot; in the book of Exodus. [I myself often use the online concordance: BLUE LETTER BIBLE.]

10. Here are three other verses which help complete the picture of Pharaoh&#39;s heart becoming hard:

    - Exod 3:19

      > <samp>But I know that the king of Egypt will not let you go unless compelled by a mighty hand.</samp>

    - Exod 13:15

      > <samp>For when Pharaoh stubbornly refused to let us go, the LORD killed all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both the firstborn of man and the firstborn of animals. Therefore I sacrifice to the LORD all the males that first open the womb, but all the firstborn of my sons I redeem.'</samp>

    - 1 Sam 6:6 (This is when the Philistines defeat the Israelites in battle, and capture the ark of the covenant, 1 Sam 4 &amp; 5).

      > <samp>Why should you harden your hearts as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their hearts? After he had dealt severely with them, did they not send the people away, and they departed?</samp>

11. `6 pts` What do you conclude about Pharaoh&#39;s heart becoming hard?

    <samp>
      Pharaoh's preexisting heart condition was stubborness.
      It was not in Pharaoh's nor Egypt's best intrest to let Israel go to serve the Lord.
      God's display of power through Moses as a mean to soften Pharaoh's heart.
      Pharaoh's heart remained stubborn demonstrated that the hardness of his heart was his
      unwillingness to submit to God. In the end, the last plague caused Pharaoh to relent
      from his obstinancy and yielded to God.
