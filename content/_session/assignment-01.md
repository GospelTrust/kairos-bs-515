###### NOTE
<pre>
You may also count reading Exod chs. 3–14 for this assignment as part of your Reading Report for this course.
</pre>

In this assignment, you will look at the chapters in Exodus which talk about Pharaoh&#39;s heart &lt;becoming hard&gt;.

##### The theological/spiritual question is this:

> Did God simply choose to harden Pharaoh&#39;s heart, such that Pharaoh had no choice in the matter? If that is so, then how can God hold Pharaoh morally accountable for something that God, in effect, forced him to do?

There are a total of `18 verses` in Exodus which explicitly mention this.

To find these verses, you will need to use a concordance, either a printed one, or an online concordance. You will need to search on the words &quot;hard,&quot; &quot;harden,&quot; and/or &quot;hardened&quot; in the book of Exodus. [I myself often use the online concordance: BLUE LETTER BIBLE.]
.

1. Read Exodus chs. 3–14.

   What translation are you using? __

   (You are welcome to look at more than one translation.)

2. `2 pts` Read Exod 4:21.

   How does your translation read? = Does it read, &quot;I will harden pharaoh&#39;s heart . . . &quot;, or perhaps &quot;I will cause Pharaoh&#39;s heart to be stubborn,&quot; or, something else?

3. `2 pts` Similarly, read Exod 7:3.

   How does your translation read? = Does it read, &quot;I will harden pharaoh&#39;s heart . . . &quot;, or perhaps &quot;I will cause Pharaoh&#39;s heart to be stubborn,&quot; or, something else?

4. `2 pts` Where is the very first time in the book of Exodus that it tells us &lt;Pharaoh&#39;s heart became hard&gt;, either from God hardening it, or from Pharaoh hardening it himself?

   List the ch. &amp; verse #. __

4. `2 pts` In that verse, does it say &lt;God hardened pharaoh&#39;s heart&gt;, or &lt;Pharaoh&#39;s heart became hard&gt;? Be specific.

5. `2 pts` In your translation, what is the first verse in which we are _explicitly_ told that &lt;God hardened pharaoh&#39;s heart&gt;?

6. `14 pts` How many times does the text tell us that Pharaoh&#39;s heart became hard / Pharaoh hardened his heart, before that verse?

   List the verses.

   Refer to Q #5 above. Again, what is the first verse in which we are explicitly told &lt;God hardened pharaoh&#39;s heart&gt;? __ . (no points)

7. `4 pts` After that verse, are there any more verses which speak of &lt;Pharaoh hardening his heart&gt;, or, do all the verses after that verse say &lt;God hardened Pharaoh&#39;s heart&gt;?

   If there are any verses which say &lt;Pharaoh hardened his heart / Pharaoh&#39;s heart became hard&gt;, list them.

8. `8 pts` In Exodus chs. 10 &amp; 11, list all the verses which tell us &lt;God hardened Pharaoh&#39;s heart&gt;.

9. `8 pts` In Exodus ch. 14, there are two more verses which talk about Pharaoh&#39;s heart being hard. List them. What do they say?

10. Here are three other verses which help complete the picture of Pharaoh&#39;s heart becoming hard:

    - Exod 3:19
    - Exod 13:15
    - 1 Sam 6:6 (This is when the Philistines defeat the Israelites in battle, and capture the ark of the covenant, 1 Sam 4 &amp; 5).

11. `6 pts` What do you conclude about Pharaoh&#39;s heart becoming hard?
